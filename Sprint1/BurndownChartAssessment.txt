Burndown Chart Assessment

For project management in Sprint 6, we assigned the new features, mainly the new Magic Mushroom item, gamestate, physics, music, and colors as well as
the sprites, music, Bowser, projectiles, and fire in level 1-4. As usual, there was a period of time in which no work was assigned because the group started the planning phase late. 
Then, there was a large increase as work was assigned and a later increase when more tasks were assigned based on initial implementation. 
Once work was assigned, there was a platueau in which the group was trying to figure out how to approach the work. Then, work
was completed quickly over the next few days. There was a sharp decrease in work as the group completed work over the break. Then several platueaus followed
by more work completion as the group discussed more about game design implementation, overall achieving a somewhat consistent decline in work

For the time management of Sprint 6, the group continued to use groupMe and discord for communication and talking in class and through group meetings
to discuss tasks and help one another get unstuck or understand concepts. The group made sure to ask others if they needed help so that an individual did not
fall behind on tasks and a member had something to do once their tasks were done. The group also made sure to get tasks done early so that when the
deadline approached so that we could check over everything and reduce the stress of getting tasks done last minute.
